This presentation will introduce a straightforward implementation of the [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org/) standard, designed to couple photovoltaic and atmospheric models. This approach is particularly well-suited for solar and energy forecasting applications. Key outcomes include:

- enhanced electrical output predictions through recalculated atmospheric radiative transfer,
- forecasted local environmental conditions (e.g., air temperature) resulting from panel operating conditions.

The numerical co-simulation framework is adaptable to eco-photovoltaic systems (agrivoltaics and floating PV) where accurate environmental forecasting is essential for informed decision-making.
