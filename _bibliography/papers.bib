  abstract={Assessing the impact of photovoltaic panels on solar and infrared radiation, wind speed, and turbulence is essential for understanding how these panels may affect crops or livestock in agrivoltaic (APV) systems, as well as water reservoirs in floating photovoltaic (FPV) installations. However, state-of-the-art numerical methods require huge computing resources and rarely account for many physical phenomena at the same time. This study suggests the implementation of source and sink terms within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver code_saturne, specifically in the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (U-RANS) equations and the Discrete Ordinate Radiation Model (DOM). It enables time-efficient simulations of solar and infrared radiation, wind speed, and turbulence in the presence of obstacles.}

    abstract={Evaporation reduction is one of the advantages provided by floating photovoltaic (FPV) power plants. However, few studies have yet been carried out to understand how to optimise the layout of FPV power plants in order to provide better water management. Indeed, the interaction between atmospheric conditions, water bodies, and the FPV plant creates a dynamic system that is challenging to study and accurately model. This paper investigates the impact on evaporation of various characteristics of FPV plants, such as float technology, plant positioning and orientation, distribution, and coverage ratio. This study was performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of the surrounding atmosphere, with the impact of the FPV plant modelled using specific boundary conditions to reduce computational costs.}

    abstract = {The temperature of photovoltaic (PV) cells is a critical factor in evaluating energy yield and predicting system degradation. Although thermo-electrical models allows predicting the evolution of the system over time, precise understanding of the thermal exchanges between the system and its environment is needed as they are implemented in the yield assessment using thermal correlations. These empirical correlations are based on heat transfer magnitudes undergone by similar PV set-ups. The aim of this study is to introduce a non-intrusive experimental methodology for precisely determining the convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) at the front of photovoltaic modules using two setups. The method integrates a heat flux sensor glued to the PV surface coupled with environmental data (e.g., irradiance, ambient temperature). This experimental method is applied to PV modules on a roof in an urban area and to a floating photovoltaic (FPV) system. It is demonstrated that the method significantly improves the accuracy of prediction of PV module temperatures in operating conditions compared to the conventional method based on the energy balance of a PV module. By using quantile regression, an empirical forced convection correlation is found based on the average wind speed. Compared to the traditional approach which relies on global transmittance, the CHTC is mainly dependent on the wind, whereas the global transmittance includes the radiative heat transfer which depends on the module temperature. The correlation for CHTC tailored for the floating photovoltaic system shows sensitivity to wind speed that is slightly higher compared to the inland setup in the literature.}

    abstract = {Reconciling the use of space and the production of low-carbon electricity is a key challenge in the face of changing human needs. In this context, floating photovoltaics (FPV) is proving to be a key application to colocate energy production with several activities (hydroelectricity and aquaculture). A major benefit of FPV technologies is the reduced module temperature. However, the causes of this thermal observation are still unknown. The density of the distribution of the floaters and the thermal behavior of the waterbody are two postulated roots that show positive correlations with regard to the module temperature. Therefore, there is interest in identifying precise thermal features in the application because the yield surplus promised in FPV technology is based on this cooling effect. This research aims to understand the heat mechanisms that arise in this application in comparison with ground-mounted photovoltaics (PV). A special framework based on 1-D thermal modeling and statistical classification of the results by dimensionless related features is proposed. This strategy offers a possibility to differentiate the influence of the thermal modes separately over the module temperature.}
